In December 2018 I started my PhD in Hydrology at the [Chair of Hydrology](http://www.hydro.uni-freiburg.de/) of the Albert Ludwigs University in Freiburg, Germany in the team of Prof. Markus Weiler. Within my PhD project I will focus on the combined effects of climate change and agricultural practice change on water quality.
I finished my MSc in Hydrology at Albert Ludwigs University in 2018. In my MSc thesis, I benchmarked and evaluated state-of-the-art large-scale hydrological models using a statistical analysis approach.
