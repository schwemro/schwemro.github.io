I recently started my PhD in Hydrology at the [Chair of Hydrology](http://www.hydro.uni-freiburg.de/) of the Albert Ludwigs University in Freiburg, Germany in the team of Markus Weiler.
I did my Master in Hydrology and my Master thesis was the evaluation of large-scale hydrological models using a statistical analysis approach.
