### The Combined Impact of Climate Change and Adapted Land Use Management on Water Quality (PhD)
- Development of a fully-distributed solute transport model ([RoGeR](http://www.hydrology.uni-freiburg.de/roger/)) in Python based on StorAge Selection functions
- Application of climate and agricultutural management scenarios
- Running a case study for an agricultural dominated Moehlin catchment located in southwest Baden-Wurttemberg
- Providing policy-relevant recommendations on mitigation measures

### Climatic and Physiographic Controls on Errors of Large-scale Hydrological Models (MSc)
- Global benchmarking of large-scale model ensemble ([eartH2Observe](https://wci.earth2observe.eu/portal/))
- Linking the model error to climatic and physiographic catchment characteristics using Random Forest ([scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/))
- Advancing process representation by identifying potential deficient model structures/paremeterizations
