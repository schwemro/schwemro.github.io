### Sustainable and consistent modelling of soil hydrologic transport processes based on travel times (PhD)
- Development of a process-based hydrologic toolbox ([Roger](https://github.com/Hydrology-IFH/roger/))
- Evaluation of [Roger](https://github.com/Hydrology-IFH/roger/) with measurements at Rietholzbach lysimeter, Switzerland
- Combined impact of climate change and crop rotation on soil hydrologic travel times


### Climatic and Physiographic Controls on Errors of Large-scale Hydrological Models (MSc)
- Global benchmarking of large-scale model ensemble ([eartH2Observe](https://wci.earth2observe.eu/portal/))
- Linking the model error to climatic and physiographic catchment characteristics using Random Forest ([scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/))
- Advancing process representation by identifying potential deficient model structures/paremeterizations
